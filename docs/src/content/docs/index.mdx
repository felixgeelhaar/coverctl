## Why coverctl?

Traditional coverage tools report a single percentage for your entire module. But real codebases have domains with different criticality levels. Your core business logic needs stricter coverage than utility functions.

**coverctl** solves this by letting you define coverage policies per domain, enforcing them in CI, and providing actionable feedback when policies fail.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Domain-Aware" icon="puzzle">
    Define coverage thresholds per domain (core, api, infrastructure). Each domain gets its own minimum requirement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CI-Ready" icon="github">
    Built for automation. JSON output, GitHub Actions annotations, and exit codes that work with any CI system.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auto-Detection" icon="magnifier">
    Automatically discovers domains from your project structure. Interactive wizard or `--no-interactive` for scripts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible Output" icon="document">
    Text, JSON, or HTML reports. Coverage badges, trend analysis, and debt tracking included.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Install coverctl
go install github.com/felixgeelhaar/coverctl@latest

# Initialize configuration
coverctl init

# Run coverage with policy enforcement
coverctl check
```

## Sample Configuration

```yaml
version: 1
policy:
  default:
    min: 75
  domains:
    - name: core
      match: ["./internal/core/..."]
      min: 85
    - name: api
      match: ["./internal/api/..."]
      min: 80
exclude:
  - internal/generated/*
```

## Features at a Glance

- **Policy Enforcement**: Set minimum coverage per domain
- **Build Flags**: Pass `--tags`, `--race`, `--timeout` to customize test runs
- **Watch Mode**: Continuous coverage during development
- **CI Integration**: `--fail-under`, `--ratchet` prevent coverage regression
- **HTML Reports**: Visual coverage reports with `-o html`
- **Coverage Badges**: Generate SVG badges for README files
- **Trend Analysis**: Track coverage over time
- **Debt Reports**: Identify files that need more tests
