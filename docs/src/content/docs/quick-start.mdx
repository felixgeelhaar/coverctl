This guide will help you set up coverctl in your Go project and run your first coverage check.

## Prerequisites

- A Go project with tests
- Go 1.24 or later installed
- coverctl installed ([Installation Guide](/coverctl/installation/))

## Setup

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to your project**

   ```bash
   cd your-go-project
   ```

2. **Initialize coverctl**

   Run the interactive setup wizard:

   ```bash
   coverctl init
   ```

   The wizard will:
   - Auto-detect domains from your project structure
   - Let you adjust coverage thresholds with arrow keys
   - Create `.coverctl.yaml` configuration

   :::tip
   Use `coverctl init --no-interactive` in CI/CD pipelines to skip the wizard.
   :::

3. **Run coverage check**

   ```bash
   coverctl check
   ```

   This will:
   - Run `go test` with coverage instrumentation
   - Evaluate coverage per domain
   - Report pass/fail status for each domain

4. **Review results**

   ```
   Domain     Coverage  Required  Status
   ─────────────────────────────────────
   core         87.3%      85%    PASS
   api          81.2%      80%    PASS
   cli          76.4%      75%    PASS
   ─────────────────────────────────────
   Overall      82.1%      75%    PASS
   ```

</Steps>

## Example Configuration

After running `coverctl init`, you'll have a `.coverctl.yaml` file:

```yaml
version: 1
policy:
  default:
    min: 75
  domains:
    - name: core
      match: ["./internal/core/..."]
      min: 85
    - name: api
      match: ["./internal/api/..."]
      min: 80
    - name: cli
      match: ["./cmd/..."]
      min: 75
exclude:
  - "**/generated/**"
  - "**/mocks/**"
```

## Common Workflows

### Development Mode

Use watch mode for continuous feedback while developing:

```bash
coverctl watch
```

### CI Pipeline

Run with JSON output and strict thresholds:

```bash
coverctl check -o json --fail-under 80
```

### Generate HTML Report

Create a visual coverage report:

```bash
coverctl report -o html > coverage.html
```
